## Active

### Games

- [Python Text RPG](https://github.com/thekamboy/pythontextrpg) (will get back to this soon!)
- There is one other active game, but its private for now as I get the demo ready.

## Inactive

### Games

- [Ghost Team: DND](https://github.com/thekamboy/gt-dnd)
- [INSERT RANDOMNESS](https://github.com/thekamboy/insert_randomness) (I still ran out of ideas, even with a game about random ideas.)
- [Ghost Team: Computer Trouble](https://github.com/thekamboy/gt-computer-trouble)
- [simple auto runner](https://github.com/thekamboy/simple_auto_runner) (I don't even think I worked on this...)

### Forks

- [Crisis Engine](https://github.com/thekamboy/crisis-engine-reborn) (JS Engine, the latest Psych Engine version, and HRK Engine are way better.)

### Discord Bots

- [KamFurDev's Utility Bot](https://github.com/thekamboy/kfd-utility-bot) (stopped working on it after I stopped using it in my server.)

### Programming Libraries

- [Simple Console Menu](https://github.com/thekamboy/simple-console-menu) (way better options out there for making tui menus in Go.)

### Misc

- [dotedit bash](https://github.com/thekamboy/dotedit-bash)
- [Kanagawa theme for HyDE](https://github.com/thekamboy/hyde-kanagawa) (there is a proper kanagawa theme for HyDE, so use that)

## Software Addons

- [Catppuccin Mocha Syntax for Pulsar/Atom](https://github.com/thekamboy/catppuccin-mocha-syntax) (inactive, not sure if it still works)
- [Sweet Theme for Warp Terminal](https://github.com/thekamboy/sweet-theme-warp-terminal) (inactive, most likely works)
- [ElementaryOS Theme for Alacritty](https://github.com/thekamboy/alacritty-elementary-theme) (inactive, doesn't work since alacritty moved from yaml to toml)
